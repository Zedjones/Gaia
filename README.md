# Gaia
The Gaia database contains billions of stars. Using data mining techniques, identify groups of stars that belong together.

Github is crappy at opening jupyter notebooks sometimes for some reason.
- If it doesn't work and you get the error message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?"
- Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.
  - Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
  - Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/lauramv1832/Gaia/blob/master/Gaia.ipynb") there 
and then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lauramv1832/Gaia/blob/master/Gaia.ipynb"
